Application for rendering and processing data for medical monitoring device.

## Initial Planning
We are planning to make a python based client for processing data sent by our hardware module over Bluetooth 
using Bluetooth Low Energy libraries. We also have to process the data in a meaningful and efficient manner 
to produce quick and a responsive application.

## Timeline
Time Duration : *60 days*

The tasks we need to deliver during the time period can be done in this following priority:

Task 1: We will first target towards making a server-side application to recieve and process data from our hardware module over python and its BLE libraries.  
Task 2: Make a client-side application to display the data and mock some features which we plan to do with this device.  
Task 3: Check if we need some mobile application for our interface and if time permits, we can work on it.

## Running the project

  - `gulp serve` and then go to `localhost:3000`
